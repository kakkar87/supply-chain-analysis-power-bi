# Supply Chain Analysis Power BI
A2Z Mart, a rapidly expanding FMCG manufacturer based in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, currently operates in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana. Within these states, they are active in 15 cities. For this project, we will focus on their operations in three towns in Gujarat: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara.

# Problem Statement
A2Z Mart is experiencing issues in Gujarat, where several key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to service-related problems. It is speculated that some essential products were either not delivered on time or in full over an extended period, leading to poor customer service. Management aims to resolve this issue before expanding to other cities in Gujarat. They have tasked their supply chain analytics team with tracking the 'On-Time' and 'In-Full' delivery service levels for all customers daily, enabling swift responses to any problems.

# Task
As the new data analyst on the supply chain team at Atliq Mart, I recently attended a stakeholder business review meeting where I was briefed on my tasks. I am excited to tackle the challenge of building a dashboard and performing the following tasks:

1. Create a dashboard according to the requirements outlined by stakeholders during the business review meeting.
2. Utilize the comic-style transcript of the business review meeting to generate additional relevant insights not covered in the metrics list or stakeholder meeting.
